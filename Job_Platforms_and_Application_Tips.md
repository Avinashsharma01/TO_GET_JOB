## 3. Application Tips & Tricks (Practical)

A. Tailor Your Resume Quickly
- Keep a master resume and create targeted versions. Replace 3–6 keywords to mirror each JD.
- For roles requiring AWS, add "AWS (S3/EC2)" to skills if you've practiced basics.
- Use the job title verbatim in your resume summary when appropriate ("Full-Stack Developer").

B. Optimize LinkedIn
- Headline: "Full-Stack Developer (MERN) | B.Tech IT '26 | React, Node.js, TypeScript"
- About section: 3-4 lines summarizing projects and what you're seeking.
- Add featured projects with links to live demos and GitHub.
- Turn on "Open to work" with job preferences.
- Add keywords in Skills and endorse/obtain endorsements.

C. Use Easy Apply Wisely
- For Easy Apply, keep a concise resume and a 1-line custom message in the LinkedIn "note" field.
- Always follow up with a short LinkedIn message to the recruiter within 48 hours.

D. Apply Timing
- Apply within 24–48 hours of posting to increase visibility.
- Apply early in the week (Mon–Wed) and early in the day (local time).

E. Volume + Quality Balance
- Daily target: 15–25 high-quality applications (tailored), or 30–50 if using bulk sites like Naukri but still customizing.
- Spend 15–30 minutes tailoring each Tier A/B application; spend 5–10 minutes for mass Tier C.

F. Use Alerts and Saved Searches
- Set alerts on LinkedIn, Wellfound, Naukri for keywords like: "MERN", "Full-Stack", "React", "Node.js", "Junior Developer".
- Use email filters to keep job replies organized.

G. Prepare for Code Tests
- Many companies send HackerRank or Codility tests. Practice timed tests weekly.
- For timed tests, solve easy problems first and mark medium ones to revisit.

H. Follow-up Sequence
- After applying: wait 4–7 days, then LinkedIn message to recruiter
- If interviewed: send thank-you email same day
- If no reply after follow-up, move on and reapply after 3 months with updated resume

I. Ask for Referrals
- Identify alumni/peers working at target companies via LinkedIn
- Use a short message to ask for a quick chat first, then request referral
- Offer to share one-liner about why you're a fit (makes it easier for referrer)

J. Use Networking Events
- Attend local meetups, hackathons, and college alumni events
- Present a demo of your project; recruiters notice active contributors

## 4. How to Track Applications (Spreadsheet template)
Columns to include:
- Company | Role | Link to JD | Date Applied | Source | Resume Version | Contact Name | Contact Info | Status | Follow-up Date | Notes

Status states:
- Applied | Viewed | Recruiter Reachout | Recruiter Screen | Technical Round | HR Round | Offer | Rejected | No Response

Tips:
- Color code rows: green (active), yellow (waiting), red (rejected)
- Update daily; set calendar reminders for follow-ups

## 5. Messaging & Outreach Templates (Short)
1) Quick LinkedIn Note when applying (1–2 lines):
"Hi [Name], I just applied for [Role] at [Company]. I'm a MERN developer with 4 deployed projects—would love to chat if you're hiring. Portfolio: yoursite"

2) Cold email subject line ideas:
- "MERN Developer Application — Avinash Sharma"
- "Interested in [Role] — Built [Project name]"

3) Follow-up after application (LinkedIn or email):
"Hi [Name], I applied for [Role] on [date]. I’d love to briefly share how my MERN experience can help [Company]'s [product/team]. Portfolio: link"

## 6. Nailing Tests and Technical Screens
- Timebox: allocate 1.5–2 hours for online coding tests.
- Read all problems first, solve easy ones first, then medium.
- Use clear variable names and comments for readability.
- Submit working solutions even if not optimal; partial credit matters.
- If stuck, leave notes in code and briefly explain the approach in comments.

---

## 7. Interview Scheduling & Negotiation
- When you get multiple interviews/offers, compare by role, tech, learning, compensation, location/remote, and growth.
- Ask about salary range early if recruiter doesn't provide it: "Can you share the salary range for this role?" is fine.
- If offered: request 24–48 hours to consider and compare other opportunities.

---

## 8. Quick Daily/Weekly Action Plan
Daily:
- 2 DSA problems (60–90 min)
- 15 tailored applications (2 hours)
- 10–15 minutes LinkedIn engagement
- 1 hour project/improvement or test practice

Weekly:
- 70–100 applications
- 3–5 follow-ups
- 2 mock interviews
- 1 LinkedIn post (project update/learning)

---

## 9. Red Flags in Job Postings
- Vague job descriptions ("must be a fast learner") with no tech stack
- Unclear interview process or extremely long process (10+ steps)
- Unrealistic salary vs expectations for the role
- Contract-to-hire that doesn't specify conversion terms

---

## 10. Final Tips (Mindset & Efficiency)
- Focus on consistency: 90 days of steady work beats 1 week of frantic applications.
- Improve by iterations: track which templates and messages produce responses and refine them.
- Keep polishing a few high-impact projects rather than starting many small ones.
- Stay healthy — interviews are a marathon.
