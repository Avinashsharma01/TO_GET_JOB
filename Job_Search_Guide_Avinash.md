- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Ansible)

### 📈 Career Path Options

**Short-term (0-1 year):**
```
Junior MERN Developer → Work on production code → Build real-world experience
```

**Long-term Options (2-5 years):**
```
Option A: Full-Stack → Senior Full-Stack → Tech Lead → Engineering Manager

- LeetCode Medium: 40 problems
- Company-tagged problems for target companies

#### Round 2: Technical Interview - JavaScript Deep Dive

**Core JavaScript Questions:**
```javascript
// 1. Explain Event Loop
// Answer: Single-threaded, call stack, callback queue, microtask queue

// 2. What's the output?
console.log(1);
setTimeout(() => console.log(2), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(3));
console.log(4);
// Output: 1, 4, 3, 2 (microtasks before macrotasks)

// 3. Closures
function outer() {
    let count = 0;
    return function inner() {
        count++;
        return count;
    }
}
const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2

// 4. this keyword
const obj = {
    name: 'Avinash',
    greet: function() { console.log(this.name); },
    greetArrow: () => { console.log(this.name); }
};
obj.greet(); // 'Avinash'
obj.greetArrow(); // undefined (arrow doesn't bind this)

// 5. Promises vs Async/Await
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}

// 6. Debounce Implementation
function debounce(fn, delay) {
    let timeoutId;
    return function(...args) {
        clearTimeout(timeoutId);
        timeoutId = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
    }
}

// 7. Throttle Implementation
function throttle(fn, limit) {
    let inThrottle;
    return function(...args) {
        if (!inThrottle) {
            fn.apply(this, args);
            inThrottle = true;
            setTimeout(() => inThrottle = false, limit);
        }
    }
}
```

**Topics to Master:**
- [ ] Hoisting (var vs let vs const)
- [ ] Prototypes and inheritance
- [ ] Event delegation and bubbling
- [ ] Memory leaks and garbage collection
- [ ] ES6+ features (spread, destructuring, modules)

#### Round 3: React Interview Questions

**Common Questions:**
```jsx
// 1. Virtual DOM
// Answer: In-memory representation, diffing algorithm, batch updates

// 2. useEffect cleanup
useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = subscribeToData();
    return () => {
        subscription.unsubscribe(); // Cleanup
    };
}, [dependency]);

// 3. useMemo vs useCallback
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensive(a, b), [a, b]);
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => doSomething(a, b), [a, b]);

// 4. Context API
const ThemeContext = createContext('light');
function App() {
    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
            <Component />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
}
function Component() {
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
}

// 5. Custom Hook Example
function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
    const [value, setValue] = useState(() => {
        const stored = localStorage.getItem(key);
        return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : initialValue;
    });
    
    useEffect(() => {
        localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
    }, [key, value]);
    
    return [value, setValue];
}

// 6. Why keys are important
// Answer: Help React identify which items changed, added, or removed
// Never use index as key when list can reorder
```

**Topics to Master:**
- [ ] Component lifecycle (class vs functional)
- [ ] State management (Context, Redux, Zustand)
- [ ] Performance optimization (memo, lazy loading)
- [ ] Error boundaries
- [ ] Server-side rendering basics

#### Round 4: Node.js & Backend Questions

**Common Questions:**
```javascript
// 1. Event-driven architecture
// Answer: Non-blocking I/O, event emitter pattern, callbacks

// 2. Middleware in Express
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request received');
    next(); // Pass to next middleware
});

// 3. Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
});

// 4. JWT Authentication Flow
// 1. User logs in with credentials
// 2. Server verifies, creates JWT with payload
// 3. Client stores token (httpOnly cookie preferred)
// 4. Client sends token in Authorization header
// 5. Server verifies token on protected routes

### 🗣️ Explaining Your Projects (STAR Method)

**Template:**
```
SITUATION: "I identified a problem where [problem statement]..."

TASK: "My goal was to build [solution] that would [outcome]..."

ACTION: "I implemented [specific features] using [technologies]. 
        The challenging part was [challenge], which I solved by [solution]..."

RESULT: "The final product [achievement/metric]. 
        I learned [key learning] and would improve [reflection]..."
```

**Example for Academic Notes System:**
```
SITUATION: 
"Students at my university struggled to organize and share academic notes 
efficiently. The existing methods were fragmented and lacked real-time 
collaboration features."

TASK: 
"I decided to build a full-stack Learning Management System that would 
allow students to upload, organize, and search notes instantly, while 
giving administrators control over content moderation."

ACTION: 
"I built the frontend using React with Redux for state management. 
The backend used Node.js with Express, and I chose MongoDB for flexible 
document storage. 

The challenging part was implementing real-time search that felt instant. 
I solved this by implementing debounced search with indexed MongoDB queries, 
reducing search latency from 2 seconds to under 200ms.

For authentication, I implemented JWT with refresh tokens, ensuring 
sessions could persist securely for up to 7 days."

RESULT: 
"The platform successfully served 100+ test users during development. 
I learned how to architect full-stack applications with proper separation 
of concerns. If I were to rebuild it, I would add unit tests from the 
start and implement a caching layer with Redis."
```

### ❌ Interview Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | What to Do Instead |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Saying "I don't know" immediately | Shows lack of problem-solving | "I haven't used this directly, but based on my understanding of [related concept]..." |
| Coding without discussing approach | Interviewers can't evaluate your thinking | Explain your approach first, get confirmation, then code |
| Ignoring edge cases | Shows incomplete thinking | Always ask: "What about empty input? Null? Very large values?" |
| Not asking clarifying questions | Assumptions lead to wrong solutions | Ask about constraints, expected input/output, scale |
| Speaking negatively about past work | Red flag for team culture | Focus on what you learned, not what was wrong |
| Overselling yourself | Easily caught in follow-up questions | Be honest about your experience level |
| Not admitting mistakes | Shows inability to learn | "You're right, I missed that. Let me reconsider..." |

| "They rejected me" | "They chose someone with different experience" |

**After Every Rejection:**
