# LinkedIn Job-Hunting Guide for Avinash Sharma

Last updated: December 30, 2025

Purpose: Practical, step-by-step instructions to optimize your LinkedIn profile, grow a targeted network, find and apply to roles, and convert connections into interviews — tailored for a MERN/full-stack developer.

---

## Quick Action Summary (Do these first)
1. Update your headline and About section (15–30 minutes).
2. Add 4 featured projects with live links + GitHub (30–60 minutes).
3. Send 20 personalized connection requests to engineers at target companies (1 day).
4. Apply to 10 jobs via LinkedIn and follow up with 10 recruiters (ongoing daily).

---

## 1. Profile Optimization (High impact)

1. Profile photo
   - Use a clear headshot with neutral background, smile, good lighting.
   - Dress like an engineer (neat casual). Crop to shoulders/head.

2. Background banner
   - Simple banner showing “Full-Stack Developer | MERN” or a screenshot of your portfolio.

3. Headline (one line; include role + stack)
   - Example: Full-Stack Developer (MERN) • React, Node.js, TypeScript • B.Tech IT '26
   - Why: Headline is searchable — include keywords recruiters use.

4. Location & Open-to-work
   - Set location to your city + mark "Open to work" with roles and remote preference.

5. About section (3–5 short paragraphs)
   - First sentence: who you are and what you do.
   - Next: 2 bullets or sentences listing top tech + one notable project/metric.
   - Last: what you’re looking for and call-to-action ("Message me for referrals/roles").

Example About:
```
Full-Stack Developer (MERN) and B.Tech IT student experienced building production-ready web apps: an LMS with real-time features, a student marketplace, and an institution ERP.

Tech: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Socket.IO.

I'm seeking junior Full-Stack/SDE roles. Portfolio: yoursite.vercel.app • GitHub: github.com/yourname
Message me for referrals or quick chats.
```

6. Experience / Projects entries
   - Add concise bullets for each project under "Experience" (or in a separate Projects section using LinkedIn's project feature).
   - Include live demo, GitHub links, and one metric or improvement.

7. Featured section
   - Pin 4 items: portfolio link, 2 project live demos, GitHub repo.

8. Skills & Endorsements
   - Add 20 skills; prioritize: React, Node.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, MongoDB, REST API, Git, Docker.
   - Ask peers to endorse the top 10.

9. Recommendations
   - Request 2 short recommendations from professors or collaborators focusing on teamwork or technical contribution.

10. URL & Contact
   - Set custom LinkedIn URL (linkedin.com/in/avinash-sharma or similar)
   - Ensure email visible in contact info

---

## 2. Network Strategy (Who to connect with and how)

1. Target list (start with 50–100):
   - Alumni from your university in tech
   - Developers at target companies (product companies, startups)
   - Recruiters who hire for MERN/full-stack roles
   - Engineers who posted helpful content you want to engage with

2. Connection message template (short & personalized)
```
Hi [Name],
I’m Avinash, a MERN developer building web apps (LMS, marketplace). I enjoyed your post about [topic]/saw you work at [Company]. I’d love to connect and learn about your engineering experience there.
```

3. Weekly outreach cadence
   - Weekdays: Send 5–10 personalized connection requests/day for 2 weeks
   - After connecting: send a thank-you message + one question about their team (do not ask for a referral right away)

4. How to ask for a referral (after rapport)
   - Build a short relationship: comment on 2 posts, reply to messages.
   - Request referral message (short):
```
Hi [Name],
Thanks again for connecting. I’m applying for [Role] at [Company]. I’ve built X (link) and believe I’m a good fit. Would you be comfortable referring me? I can share a one-line summary and my resume.
```

---

## 3. Content Strategy (Build visibility & trust)

1. Post types (rotate weekly)
   - Project demo (screenshot/GIF + short story) — 1x/week
   - Learning note (DSA/React pattern) — 1x/week
   - Resource share (useful article + short take) — 1x/2 weeks
   - Progress update (deployments, tests added) — 1x/2 weeks

2. Post structure
   - Hook (1 line) + 3 bullets + CTA ("Ask me about X" or "Check demo")
   - Use 3 relevant hashtags (#ReactJS #WebDev #FullStack)
   - Add 1 image/GIF for higher engagement

3. Engagement
   - Comment on 10 posts/week with thoughtful, value-adding comments
   - Share two posts/month with your take

4. Metrics to track
   - Weekly views, engagement rate (likes/comments), new connections from posts

---

## 4. Job Discovery & Application via LinkedIn

1. Saved searches & alerts
   - Save searches for "Full-Stack Developer", "MERN", "Junior Developer", set Daily alerts

2. Using Easy Apply vs Company Apply
   - Easy Apply: quick, but generic. Use for volume.
   - Company Apply: more steps but higher conversion; tailor resume and cover note.

3. Application ritual (per application)
   - Tailor 2–3 lines in resume summary to mirror JD
   - Add 1-line note in LinkedIn "message to recruiter" field referencing one relevant project
   - After applying: find recruiter or engineer and send a short message (see templates below)

4. Follow-up schedule
   - Day 3–5: Message recruiter (if found) politely referencing your application
   - Day 10: Final follow-up, then mark as "no response" and move on

Templates:
- After applying (to recruiter):
```
Hi [Name], I applied for [Role] at [Company] (submitted [date]). I’m a MERN developer and built [project link]. I’d appreciate any guidance or a quick chat about the role. — Avinash
```

- If recruiter replies requesting resume: send resume + 2-line TL;DR of fit

## 5. Recruiter & Hiring Manager Outreach (Cold messages)

Short cold message (first contact):
```
Hi [Name],
I’m Avinash, a MERN developer (React, Node.js). I noticed [Company] is hiring for [Role]. I’ve built 4 full-stack projects (LMS, marketplace) and would love to discuss how I can help the team. Portfolio: [link]
Could we schedule 10 minutes this week? Thanks for your time.
```

If you get no reply in 7 days, send a polite follow-up:
```
Hi [Name],
Just checking in on my previous message. I’m still very interested in [Company] and would appreciate any pointers. Thanks! — Avinash
```

How to prioritize replies:
- Reply within 12–24 hours.
- If a recruiter asks for availability, give 2–3 slots in their timezone.

---

## 6. Using LinkedIn Features Effectively

1. Alumni tool
   - Filter by company & job function to find alumni working at target companies
   - Message alumni with a connection + mention shared school

2. Groups
   - Join 5 LinkedIn groups for developers and startups; participate weekly

3. Events
   - Add local or virtual tech events; attend and connect with speakers

4. LinkedIn Learning
   - Display relevant completed courses on profile (TypeScript, React, AWS)

5. Open to Work frame
   - Use discreet mode if you don’t want current employer to see (show recruiters only)

---

## 7. Interview Prep via LinkedIn

1. Use "People Also Viewed" to find engineers at the company and read their posts to understand culture
2. Search for interview experiences and questions shared by ex-employees
3. Message connections for a 15-min informational chat to ask about interview format and tips

---

## 8. Metrics & Weekly Routine (Track what matters)

Weekly routine (4–6 hours/day during job hunt):
