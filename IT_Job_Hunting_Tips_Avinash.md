# IT Job-Hunting Tips & Tricks — Avinash Sharma

Last updated: December 30, 2025

Purpose: Practical, actionable tips and advice specifically for early-career candidates in the IT sector (especially MERN / Full-Stack developers). Use this as a daily checklist and reference during your job search.

---

## 1. Mindset & Strategy (What to prioritize)
- Treat your job search like a short-term product with measurable goals: weekly applications, interviews, and learning goals.
- Focus on consistency: daily small wins compound (apply, code, network).
- The first job is the hardest — think of it as trade-off between learning and immediate salary.
- Track every application and activity in one place (spreadsheet/Notion). Measure response rate and adjust.

---

## 2. Application Math & Targets
- Reasonable target: 15–25 tailored applications/day (mix of Tier A/B/C platforms). Adjust to capacity.
- Expected conversion (approx): 100 apps → 10–20 responses → 5–10 interviews → 1–2 offers.
- If response rate < 5% after 50 apps, revise resume, cover note, and application messaging.

---

## 3. Resume & Profile Tips (High leverage)
- One page preferred for entry-level; use clear sections: Header, Title/Summary, Skills, Projects, Education, Certifications.
- Projects are your experience: list 3–4 with tech stack, what you built, and measurable outcome.
- Add live demo and GitHub links in every project entry.
- Tailor resume for each role: swap 3–6 keywords to match the JD (honestly).
- Keep an "ATS-friendly" copy: simple layout, standard headings, PDF named as `Avinash_Sharma_Resume.pdf`.

---

## 4. Projects & Portfolio (What recruiters look for)
- Deploy your projects: recruiters want live demos. Use Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Render/Railway for backend.
- Each project README should include purpose, tech stack, screenshots, setup steps, and what you learned.
- Add one project demonstrating production concerns: authentication (JWT), file uploads, rate limiting, tests, or CI.
- Keep a short video/GIF (30–60s) showing the app — it increases click-throughs.

---

## 5. Networking (High ROI activities)
- Prioritize warm connections: alumni, classmates, previous collaborators.
- Message politely and specifically (mention project/JD or a post they wrote).
- Ask for informational chats first (10–15 min), then ask for referral if rapport exists.
- Post about your project deployments and learning; tag people you collaborated with.

---

## 6. Platforms & Where to Apply (Fast summary)
- LinkedIn: primary — apply + message recruiters/engineers.
- Wellfound (AngelList): startups — apply + message founders/CTOs if possible.
- Company career pages: direct and high value for product firms.
- Naukri/Indeed: volume — use alerts.
- Internshala: internships that convert.
- Remote boards (RemoteOK, WeWorkRemotely) and freelance sites for short contracts.

---

## 7. Messaging & Follow-ups (Templates & timing)
- Apply → Wait 3–5 days → Message recruiter/engineer → Wait 7–10 days → Final follow-up.
- Keep messages short: 2–3 lines + 1 link (portfolio or GitHub).
- Example (after applying):
  "Hi [Name], I applied for [Role] on [date]. I'm a MERN dev with a deployed LMS (link). Would love to discuss my fit. — Avinash"

---

## 8. Coding Tests & Assessments (Practical tips)
- Timebox: 90–120 minutes per test. Read all problems first.
- Solve easiest problems first, then medium.
- Use clear variable names and add brief comments explaining approach.
- If partial solution, explain approach in comments — interviewers can award partial credit.
- Practice on HackerRank, LeetCode, and timed mock tests.

---

## 9. Interview Prep (What to focus on)
- Data Structures & Algorithms: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, HashMaps, Two pointers, Sliding window, Basic DP.
- JavaScript fundamentals: closures, event loop, promises, async/await, `this`, prototypal inheritance.
- React: hooks, component patterns, state management, performance optimizations, testing (RTL + Jest).
- Node.js & APIs: middleware, authentication, error handling, database queries and indexes.
- System Design (junior level): design small scalable services (URL shortener, auth system, chat).
- Practice explaining projects using STAR; prepare diagrams and architecture notes.

---

## 10. Negotiation & Offers (Junior-level guidance)
- Get the offer in writing; ask for 24–48 hours to decide if you need time to compare.
- Evaluate offers on: role growth, tech stack, mentorship, learning opportunities, compensation, location/remote.
- For early-career roles, prioritize learning and mentorship over a small salary difference.
- If you must negotiate, ask for a slightly higher salary or signing bonus based on market research.

---

## 11. Time Management & Daily Routine
- Sample job-hunt day (6–8 hours):
  - 1.5h DSA practice
  - 2h Applications (tailored)
  - 1h Project work/improvements
  - 30m Networking & LinkedIn
  - 1h Mock interview or interview prep
- Batch tasks: set 2 blocks daily for applying and 1 block for coding practice.

---

## 12. Quick Wins (Do these this week)
1. Deploy all projects with working links and add to GitHub READMEs.
2. Rewrite your resume using the Project Template in `Resume_Guide_Avinash.md`.
3. Create a short GIF demo for your top project.
4. Send 50 personalized LinkedIn connection requests to alumni and engineers.
5. Apply to 50 roles across LinkedIn, Wellfound, and company pages within 10 days.

## 13. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them
- Pitfall: Applying without tailoring → Low response rate. Fix: 2–3 keyword swaps at minimum.
- Pitfall: No live demos → Lower visibility. Fix: deploy to free hosting and add links in resume and LinkedIn.
- Pitfall: Asking for referrals immediately → Build rapport first.
- Pitfall: Overqualifying yourself in JD matching → Apply when you meet ~60% of must-haves.

---

## 14. Tools & Templates (Short list)
- Tracking: Google Sheets or Notion template (applications tracker)
- Coding practice: LeetCode, NeetCode, InterviewBit
- Mock interviews: Pramp, Interviewing.io
- Deployment: Vercel, Render, Railway, Netlify
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Collaboration: GitHub (clean repos + README)

---

## 15. Next-level Moves (When ready)
- Get a mentor for 1:1 review and mock interviews.
- Contribute to open-source projects (small fixes) — great conversation starters in interviews.
- Publish 1 technical article or a project post on LinkedIn/Medium describing a hard problem and your solution.
