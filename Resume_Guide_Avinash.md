# Resume Guide for Avinash Sharma

Last updated: December 30, 2025

Goal: Help you create a focused, ATS-friendly, and interview-winning resume tailored to MERN/full-stack roles.

---

## 1. Resume Goals (What your resume must achieve)
- Pass ATS screening for targeted job descriptions.
- Communicate impact and ownership of projects clearly.
- Be scannable by recruiters in 6–10 seconds.
- Provide direct links to live projects, GitHub, and portfolio.

---

## 2. Format & Structure (One-page preferred for entry-level)
1. Header (1 line): Name | phone | email | GitHub | LinkedIn | Portfolio
2. Title & Summary (2–3 lines): Strong single-line title and a 2-line summary tailored to MERN/full-stack roles.
3. Skills (compact list): Grouped by Frontend, Backend, Tools, Databases.
4. Projects (top 4, each 3–5 bullets): Show impact, tech stack, links.
5. Education: Degree, institution, expected graduation, relevant coursework (optional).
6. Certifications & Awards (brief): Only relevant ones.
7. Interests (1 line): Keep it professional and relevant.

---

## 3. Header & Contact
- Use a professional email (you already have avinashsharma31384@gmail.com — ok).
- GitHub: make sure your username is tidy and profile has README and pinned repos.
- LinkedIn: public profile URL; include it and ensure headline matches resume title.
- Portfolio: link to deployed projects (must be live).

Example header:
Avinash Sharma | +91 6201693634 | avinashsharma31384@gmail.com | GitHub: github.com/yourname | LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/yourname | Portfolio: yoursite.vercel.app

---

## 4. Title & Summary (Replace Objective)
- Title (single short phrase): "Full-Stack Developer (MERN) — B.Tech IT '26"
- Summary (2–3 lines): Focus on what you build, with 1 metric if possible.

Example:
Full-Stack Developer (MERN) with practical experience building 4 production-ready web applications (LMS, marketplace, institution ERP). Proficient in React, Node.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript. Seeking SDE/Full-Stack roles to build scalable, user-centered products.

Why this works: Short, keyword-rich, aligned to job titles.

---

## 5. Skills Section (ATS and recruiter friendly)
- Structure as categories and use commas; keep to 12–20 key items.

Example:
Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Redux
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, RESTful APIs, JWT
Database: MongoDB, Mongoose
Tools: Git, Docker, Postman, Vercel, Render
Other: Socket.IO, Cloudinary, Multer

Tip: Mirror keywords from job descriptions for roles you apply to (e.g., "GraphQL", "AWS"), but be honest.

---

## 6. Projects (Make these the centre of your resume)
- Pick top 3–4 projects. Each project should have:
  - Title + short context (1 line)
  - 3 bullets: what you built, how you built it (tech), measurable result or learning
  - Live demo and GitHub links

Template for a project entry:
Project Title | Tech Stack | Live: link | Code: link
• Built [what] that [what problem solved/for whom].
• Implemented [key features/architecture], using [tech].
• Result: [metric, improvement, user count, performance gain] or "Learned X" if metric not available.

Example (improved):
Academic Notes Management System | MERN | Live: https://notes.example | GitHub: github.com/av/notes
• Built an LMS allowing students to upload and search notes; implemented JWT auth and Multer for secure uploads.
• Implemented debounced, indexed search reducing average query latency from 2s to 0.2s.
• Deployed on Vercel/Render; handled 100+ test users during trials.

Tips:
- Use action verbs: Built, Implemented, Deployed, Designed, Optimized.
- Whenever possible add metrics: users, percent improvements, latency, storage reduced.
- If no quantitative metrics, add qualitative achievements ("reduced code complexity", "improved UX").

---

## 7. Education & Certifications (Concise)
- Education: Degree, institution, year range, GPA if >7.5
- Certifications: List only relevant certs (DSA, Cloud Computing, Web Design). Add year.

Example:
B.Tech Information Technology, Swami Vivekanand Subharti University — 2022–2026 (4th Year)
Certifications: DSA with Java (NPTEL, 2023), Cloud Computing (NPTEL, 2025)

---

## 8. Extras: What to Avoid
- Avoid a long paragraph Objective — use Summary instead.
- Don’t include photos, DOB, religion, or unnecessary personal details.
- Avoid vague buzzwords without proof ("hard-working", "passionate").

---

## 9. ATS Tips
- Use standard section headers: "Projects", "Education", "Skills".
- Avoid images, fancy columns, and text boxes — they break parsers.
- Use simple bullets and plain fonts.
- Save as PDF when the job asks for PDF; otherwise submit as plain text/Word when requested.
- Match exact phrases from the job posting ("RESTful APIs", "TypeScript") if you have them.

---

## 10. Resume Checklist (Before Applying)
- [ ] Name, phone, email, GitHub, LinkedIn, Portfolio present
- [ ] Title & 2-line summary tailored for role
- [ ] Top 3–4 projects with live links and GitHub links
